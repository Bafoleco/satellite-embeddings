#  Creating Satellite Image Embeddings with Multi-Task Learning

While this repo is forked from MOSAIKS, none of their implementation is actually in use. We made this decision at the beginning of the project in case we wanted to build off of some of their infrastructure. However, all the code used in our project is original and placed in the src folder. MOSAIKS code has been removed for clarity.
